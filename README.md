## About Me

Hi! I’m **Dat Tran**, a Computer Information Systems student with a focus on data analysis and business intelligence. I’m interested in using data to understand business performance, diagnose problems, and propose data-driven solutions. My work emphasizes clear financial analysis, structured thinking, and practical recommendations for decision-makers.

This portfolio documents my hands-on projects as I build experience across Excel, SQL, Python, and BI tools.

In this project, I acted as a consultant for an e-commerce company experiencing stagnating profits. Using Microsoft Excel, I analyzed the company’s financial and product-level data to understand what was driving performance changes and where improvements could be made.

### Project Overview
- Cleaned and structured raw financial data
- Built a dynamic **Profit & Loss (P&L) dashboard** with year selection
- Analyzed profitability metrics including Gross Profit, EBIT, EBITDA, and Net Earnings
- Investigated **product-level performance**, including units sold and average daily profit
- Summarized findings and proposed actionable recommendations to improve profitability

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, formulas, dashboards, data cleaning)

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze business data end-to-end, translate numbers into insights, and communicate findings clearly in a consulting-style format.
